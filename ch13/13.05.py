# Write a function named choose_from_hist that takes a histogram as defined 
# in Section 11.1 and returns a random value from the histogram, chosen with
# probability in proportion to frequency. For example, for this histogram:
# >>> t = ['a', 'a', 'b']
# >>> h = histogram(t)
# >>> print h
# {'a': 2, 'b': 1}
# your function should 'a' with probability 2/3 and 'b' with probability 1/3.
