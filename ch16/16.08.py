# The datetime module provides date and time objects that are similar to the
# Date and Time objects in this chapter, but they provide a rich set of methods
# and operators. Read the documentation at 
# docs.python.org/lib/datetime-date.html.
# 1. Use the datetime module to write a program that gets the current date and
# prints the day of the week.
# 2. Write a program that takes a birthday as input and prints the user's age
# and the number of days, hours, minutes and seconds until their next birthday.
