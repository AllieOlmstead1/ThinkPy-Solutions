# Write a Deck method called deal_hands that takes two parameters, the number
# of hands and the number of cards per hand, and that creates new Hand
# objects, deals the appropriate number of cards per hand, and returns a 
# list of Hand objects.
# Inheritance is a useful feature. Some programs that would be repetitive
# without inheritance can be written more elegantly with it. Inheritance can
# facilitate code reuse, since you can customize the behavior of parent
# classes without having to modify them. In some cases, the inheritance 
# structure reflects the natural structure of the problem, which makes the
# program easier to understand.
# On the other hand, inheritance can make programs difficult to read. When
# a method is invoked, it is sometimes not clear where to find its definition.
# The relevant code may be scattered among several modules. Also, many of 
# the things that can be done using inheritance can be done as well or 
# better without it.
