# Write a program that creates a GUI with a single button. When the button is
# pressed it should create a second button. When that button is pressed, it
# should create a label that says, “Nice job!”.
# What happens if you press the buttons more than once? You can see my 
# solution at thinkpython.com/code/button_demo.py
