# To check whether a word is in the word list, you could use the in operator,
# but it would be slow because it searches through the words in order.
# Because the words are in alphabetical order, we can speed things up with a
# bisection search (also known as binary search), which is similar to what 
# you do when you look a word up in the dictionary. You start in the middle
# and check to see whether the word you are looking for comes before the word
# in the middle of the list. If so, then you search the first half of the
# list the same way. Otherwise you search the second half.
# Either way, you cut the remaining search space in half. If the word list 
# has 113,809 words, it will take about 17 steps to find the word or conclude
# that itâ€™s not there.
# Write a function called bisect that takes a sorted list and a target value 
# and returns the index of the value in the list, if it's there, or None if 
# it's not.
# Or you could read the documentation of the bisect module and use that!
#
import bisect
import math

# create list of items in words.txt
wordList = [words.txt]

# determine midpoint
middle = wordList.bisect()

# choose first or second half
def bisect(wordList, word):
   if str(word) < word@middle:
       # make chosen half new reference
       # update middle with new range from [0] to midpoint
       return index
   else:
       # range from midpoint to [-1]
       return index
